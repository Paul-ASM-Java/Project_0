# Project_0
This is my first project, mostly used for training in programming. I want to start learning Java or Python (But Java is more interesting for me). 
Of course, I know, that it sounds stupid, cause I have to know what I want. So, I`ll try to start both of them and after some time I will choose better one.

P.S. I also want to learn Assembler x86, at least, basicly, cause I really like old x86 computers, which support DOS-like OS`s (80486 and older). 
      Games, special drivers, other crap... I just want to start creating such simple things just for fun :)
